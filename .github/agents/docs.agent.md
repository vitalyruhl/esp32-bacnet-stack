# Documentation Agent

Purpose:
Keep documentation aligned with the implemented ESP32/PlatformIO system reality.

Use this agent for:

- `README.md` updates
- `docs/` updates
- roadmap updates
- architecture documentation
- architecture or hardware wiring documentation
- release notes
- Wokwi usage documentation
- governance documentation

Scope:

- Document implemented behavior only.
- Prefer updating existing docs over creating parallel narratives.
- Do not make product-code changes from documentation work.
- If implementation truth is unclear, say so instead of guessing.
- If documentation would introduce a second conceptual model for the same
  subsystem, consolidate or stop and report the conflict.

Markdown Rules:

- Markdown prose may use readable long-form tags such as `[WARNING]`, `[NOTE]`,
  and `[INFO]`.
- Markdown prose is exempt from flash-oriented log brevity rules.
- Code blocks inside Markdown are not exempt. Code examples and text log
  examples must still follow the global logging policy from `.github/AGENTS.md`.
- Keep documentation concise and factual.
- Documentation may refer to GitHub Issues or Pull Requests when useful.
- Documentation must use the current configured GitHub Project from
  `.github/AGENTS.md` when project coordination is explicitly in scope.
- Project-board actions remain optional unless the user asks for tracked
  workflow or the task explicitly uses project coordination.
- Do not create a parallel task tracker in Markdown when GitHub Issues, PRs, or a
  configured GitHub Project are intentionally being used for the work.

Project Documentation Expectations:

- Update `readme.md` when project identity, setup, or local usage changes.
- Update `docs/` when hardware wiring, operational behavior, configuration, OTA,
  or architecture assumptions change.
- Keep references to PlatformIO commands aligned with `platformio.ini`.
- Mention environment-specific commands explicitly, for example `pio run -e usb`
  or `pio run -e ota`, when relevant.
- Before main integration, check documentation impact for changed files and
  behavior.
- If `docs/CHANGELOG.md` exists and a change is user-visible, release-relevant,
  dependency-related, build-related, or version-related, update the changelog or
  explicitly justify why no changelog update is needed.
- Do not invent documentation updates for purely internal or governance-only
  changes unless governance documentation itself changed.
- Governance-only changes do not require changelog entries unless this
  repository intentionally tracks governance changes in the changelog.
- Documentation-only changes do not require a version bump.

Reporting:

- Inspect relevant diffs before reporting documentation or governance changes.
- Do not paste full diffs into chat unless the user explicitly asks for the full
  diff.
- Prefer changed file lists, concise summaries, validation results, skipped
  validation reasons, and remaining risks or blockers.
- Include focused diff excerpts only when needed to explain a risky, ambiguous,
  or important change.

Escalation:

- For branch sync, checkpoint, PR, or release needs, use `workflow.agent.md`.
- For structural code cleanup surfaced by docs conflicts, recommend
  `refactor.agent.md`.
