# AGENTS.md

Repository guidance for contributors and coding agents.

This repository is `esp32-bacnet-stack`, a C++/ESP32 BACnet/IP stack library
project built with PlatformIO and the Arduino framework. The repository targets
Arduino/PlatformIO library use with BACnet client and server roles.

## Mandatory Governance Load Preflight

Before executing any agent command, workflow shortcut, branch action,
validation, file edit, commit, push, pull request, merge, release-branch update,
or cleanup action, the agent MUST explicitly read the applicable governance
files.

Required reads:

- `.github/AGENTS.md`
- `.github/agents/<selected-agent>.agent.md`

For workflow shortcuts, the selected agent is:

- `.github/agents/workflow.agent.md`

The agent MUST NOT rely on repository-wide search to discover these files,
because hidden directories such as `.github/` may be skipped by default search
tools.

If governance files are known by path, read them directly instead of discovering
them through search.

If using ripgrep to inspect governance, the agent MUST include hidden paths, for
example:

rg --hidden -n "workflow\.begin|workflow\.audit|workflow\.toMain|workflow\.cleanBranches" .

If using fd to inspect governance, the agent MUST include hidden paths, for
example:

fd --hidden "AGENTS|agent\.md|workflow\.agent\.md" .

Plain `rg ... .` or plain `fd ... .` MUST NOT be treated as sufficient for
governance discovery, because they may skip hidden directories such as
`.github/`.

Failure to read the required governance files is a hard blocker and must be
reported before any further action.

## Communication

- Use informal German ("du") when talking to the user.
- Keep explanations short unless detail is explicitly requested.
- After completing work, summarize briefly.
- Internal chat with the user may remain informal German according to these
  communication rules.
- Only normal chat with the user may be German by default. Repository artifacts
  must remain in English unless the user explicitly requests a different
  language for a specific artifact.

## Repository Text Language

- Governance files under `.github/`, repository documentation, generated
  project text, issue text, pull request text, review comments created by
  agents, code comments, error messages, log messages, and commit messages
  created by agents must be written in English.
- Do not translate repository artifacts to German just because the user chat is
  German.
- If a specific artifact must be written in another language, require an
  explicit user request for that artifact.

## User Text Normalization

- User prompts may contain informal German, mixed German/English wording, and
  obvious spelling mistakes.
- Normalize free text into clean English when deriving branch names, issue/PR
  titles, task labels, or governance wording.
- Do not silently normalize exact paths, commands, symbols, identifiers,
  explicitly provided names, issue/PR numbers, tags, versions, or quoted
  literals.
- If the user says to use a name exactly, preserve it.
- Check quoted path casing against repository state.
- If intent is unclear or normalization changes scope, stop and ask.
- Example: `gevernance-sharpenes` may derive `governance-sharpening`.

## GitHub Text Language

- GitHub Issue titles must be written in English.
- GitHub Issue bodies must be written in English.
- GitHub Pull Request titles and descriptions must be written in English.
- GitHub comments created by agents should be written in English unless the user
  explicitly requests otherwise.
- Do not create German GitHub issue or PR text by default.
- These rules apply only to GitHub and repository artifacts, not to normal chat
  with the user.

## Repository Scope

- Primary project configuration: `platformio.ini`.
- Main firmware source code lives under `src/`.
- Examples live under `examples/`.
- Supporting documentation lives under `docs/` and `README.md`.
- Tests live under `test/` when present.
- Support scripts and repository tooling live under `tools/`.
- Optional demo integrations may live under `examples/` when present.
- Wokwi simulation files may live under example-specific `Wokwi/` folders.
- Do not assume Python application release flows or a standalone backend web
  service unless the repository explicitly introduces them.

## Agent Routing

- `.github/AGENTS.md` is the canonical source for repository-wide rules.
- `.github/agents/control-plane.agent.md` only routes work to the correct agent.
- Use `.github/agents/refactor.agent.md` for code changes, refactors, tests, and
  build validation.
- Use `.github/agents/workflow.agent.md` for branches, issues, PRs, releases,
  checkpoints, and explicit session-close workflows.
- Use `.github/agents/docs.agent.md` for documentation work.
- Agent files may add scope-specific rules, but they must not contradict this
  file. If they do, follow this file and report the drift.

## Tracking Policy

- GitHub Issues may be used for tracked work when useful.
- GitHub Pull Requests may be used for review and integration when useful.
- GitHub Project usage is optional and repository-specific.
- Current GitHub Project: `ESP32 BACnet Stack` (TODO: record project number
  after project creation)
- When tracked workflow or project coordination is relevant, agents may use the
  configured GitHub Project.
- Do not invent mandatory project-board updates for tasks that do not actually
  use tracking.
- If the configured GitHub Project changes later, update this file and keep
  workflow guidance consistent with the new value.

## Safety Principles

- User changes are sacred. Never revert or overwrite user edits without asking.
- Analyze before modifying files.
- Do not make functional project-code changes unless explicitly requested or
  strictly required to correct governance references.
- Do not invent project rules. Preserve existing project-specific rules unless
  they are clearly obsolete or consciously replaced by newer governance.
- Do not mark an issue as solved or fixed until the user confirms it works.
- Before rename/delete operations, search references first and update them.
- Before terminal commands that modify the workspace, ensure goal and scope are
  clear.
- If requirements are ambiguous or a change impacts multiple subsystems/files,
  ask 1-3 precise questions or propose 2-3 options before editing.
- Work incrementally in small steps: fix, verify, checkpoint or commit only when
  requested, then continue.
- Work on one side branch at a time.
- Before multi-file refactors or other risky changes, ensure the baseline is
  understood and either clean, committed, or intentionally dirty by user
  request.

## Autonomy Levels

- Level A, safe: read-only actions such as search, read, and analysis may be done
  immediately.
- Level B, normal: small, clearly scoped changes may be implemented immediately.
- Level C, risky: changes involving BACnet protocol semantics, network-facing
  behavior, storage/NVS, OTA, security, build pipelines, or large refactors
  require explicit confirmation.

## Repository Workflow Rules

- Route branch, release, PR, merge, checkpoint, and cleanup operations through
  `.github/agents/workflow.agent.md`.
- Integrate into `main` through pull requests by default.
- `main` is the published or released branch.
- `release/*` branches are runnable snapshot branches and must stay buildable
  and runnable.
- `release/*` branches are versioned by release, for example `release/v4.0.0`.
- Do not assume `release/*` branches exist. Missing release branches do not
  block normal pull-request based `main` integration unless release sync is
  explicitly in scope.
- If release sync is explicitly requested and no suitable release branch exists,
  report that and skip the release update unless the user explicitly asks to
  create or update a release branch.
- `feature/*` branches are work-in-progress branches and may be unfinished or
  temporarily broken.
- Do not change `main` directly.
- Docs-only TODO updates under `docs/TODO.md` or `docs/todo_*.md` may be
  committed directly to `main` only when the user explicitly requests that
  workflow.
- If the active branch is `main` or `master` and file-changing work is
  requested, stop before editing and route through
  `.github/agents/workflow.agent.md` to create or select a proper side branch.
- The only direct-edit exception on `main` or `master` is an explicitly
  requested docs-only TODO update under `docs/TODO.md` or `docs/todo_*.md`.
- Direct pushes to `main` are forbidden unless the user explicitly requests an
  exception.
- Fast-forward integration to `main` is allowed only when the user explicitly
  requests fast-forward or `ff`.
- Workflow shortcuts may be chained only in sequence. `workflow.audit` remains
  strictly read-only and must finish by reporting blockers before any follow-up
  shortcut runs.
- If `workflow.audit` is followed by `workflow.toMain` or
  `workflow.cleanBranches`, continue only when the user explicitly requested the
  follow-up shortcut and no blockers remain.
- If blockers remain after audit, stop before merge, cleanup, release updates,
  or other destructive actions.
- Before preparing or merging changes into `main`, perform a documentation
  impact check.
- The documentation impact check must decide whether changed files or behavior
  require documentation updates.
- If documentation is affected, route the work through
  `.github/agents/docs.agent.md` before integration.
- If `docs/CHANGELOG.md` exists and the change is user-visible,
  release-relevant, dependency-related, build-related, or version-related,
  update it or explicitly justify why no changelog update is needed.
- If documentation is not affected, report that documentation sync is not
  required and why.
- Do not invent documentation updates for purely internal or governance-only
  changes unless governance documentation itself changed.
- Governance-only changes do not require changelog entries unless this
  repository intentionally starts tracking governance changes in the changelog.
- Documentation-only changes do not require a version bump.
- Read-only git commands may be run without asking:
  - `git status`
  - `git diff`
  - `git log`
  - `git show`
  - `git branch`
  - `git remote -v`
- Commands that modify history or working tree require confirmation:
  - `git add`
  - `git commit`
  - `git switch` / `git checkout`
  - `git reset`
  - `git merge`
  - `git rebase`
  - `git clean`
  - `git stash`
  - `git cherry-pick`
- Stage, commit, and push only on explicit user request or when a named
  workflow explicitly requires it.
- If staging is requested, prefer `git add -A`.
- Do not prepend `Set-Location` to git commands. Use the configured working
  directory. For non-git commands that must change directory, use
  `Push-Location` / `Pop-Location`.
- Prefer gh for PRs, CI checks, issues, and project operations when available.
- For `workflow.toMain`, commit, push, pull request creation, pull request
  merge, and branch cleanup are allowed only when explicitly requested by the
  shortcut and only after repository state, validation needs, and documentation
  impact have been checked.
- Before merging to `main`, run or report relevant validation, perform the
  documentation impact check, and report GitHub blockers such as required
  reviews, failing checks, conflicts, or branch protection.
- Owner/admin bypass may be used only when the user explicitly requested it for
  the current action. Required status checks must not be bypassed unless the
  user explicitly confirms that exception and the reason is reported.
- For `workflow.cleanBranches`, delete only branches verified as integrated.
  Do not delete active, unmerged, or ambiguous branches, and report skipped
  branches with the reason.

## Pull Request Review Policy

- Maintainer-owned PRs do not require external review by repository governance.
- Maintainer-owned PRs may be merged when required validation passed and GitHub
  branch protection allows the merge.
- External contributor PRs require review before merge. Do not merge unreviewed
  external contributions.
- Branch protection or ruleset bypass may only be used when the user explicitly
  requests owner/admin bypass for the current action.
- Do not use owner/admin bypass automatically.
- If GitHub branch protection blocks a merge because review is required, report
  the blocker and do not bypass branch protection.
- If a maintainer-owned PR is blocked only by a review requirement and required
  validation passed, report that owner/admin bypass may be possible when
  configured.
- If review is not intended for maintainer-owned PRs, recommend adjusting branch
  protection instead of bypassing it.
- Do not bypass external contributor PR review unless the user explicitly
  confirms a repository-owner exception after reviewing the PR.
- Required status checks must not be bypassed unless the user explicitly
  confirms an owner/admin exception and the reason is reported.

## Version Policy

- Require an appropriate project version bump for dependency updates,
  PlatformIO configuration changes, library metadata changes, firmware code
  changes, or example changes that affect build outputs unless the user
  explicitly says not to bump.
- Governance-only and documentation-only changes do not require a version bump.
  Report that the version bump was skipped by policy.
- Use patch version bumps for dependency updates, bug fixes, internal compatible
  changes, and build or configuration maintenance with no public API break.
- Use minor version bumps for new public features, new examples, new public
  APIs, and compatible behavior additions.
- Use major version bumps for breaking public API changes, incompatible
  storage/NVS layout changes, incompatible configuration schema changes, and
  behavior changes requiring user migration.
- `library.json` is the canonical source of truth for the esp32-bacnet-stack
  project/library version. Do not silently use README text, changelog text, or
  any example file as the source of truth.
- All other project/library version occurrences are mirrors and must be
  synchronized from `library.json` when the esp32-bacnet-stack project/library
  version changes.
- Before changing versions, release metadata, changelog/release notes, package
  metadata, library metadata, or files that may contain the project version,
  scan the repository for relevant version occurrences and report the candidate
  files found. The scan must include at least:
  - `library.json`
  - `README.md`
  - `docs/CHANGELOG.md` or the resolved changelog path when different
  - README version badges or version mentions, when present
  - any additional files found by ripgrep containing the current or target
    version string
- Suggested version scan commands:
  - `rg -n "version|VERSION|ESP_BACNET_VERSION|BACNET_STACK_VERSION" .`
  - `rg -n "<current-version>|<target-version>" .`
- The following known mirrors must carry the same esp32-bacnet-stack
  project/library version whenever the project version is changed:
  - `library.json`
  - README version badges or project/library version mentions, when present
  - changelog release headings or project/library version mentions, when
    present
  - example version references, when examples intentionally carry the
    library/app version
- If a required mirror path does not exist, report the missing path instead of
  silently ignoring it.
- The client and server examples are part of the library smoke/example baseline.
  If they gain explicit project/library version references, they must mirror the
  esp32-bacnet-stack project/library version.
- Other examples may have independent firmware/application versions. Do not
  automatically change them unless the issue explicitly asks for that example
  version to change. Preserve example-specific version policies and mention
  them in the report when relevant.
- TODO: If a Web UI or package-managed demo is added later, define whether its
  package metadata mirrors `library.json` or has an independent version before
  changing version files.
- Version changes that affect the published library/package must include a
  changelog update unless the governing issue explicitly says otherwise. Before
  editing changelog/docs, follow the docs-agent rules. If the changelog location
  is ambiguous, inspect the repository and report the resolved path.
- If version files disagree before work starts, report the mismatch before
  changing version-related files. If the intended target version is ambiguous,
  stop and ask for clarification.
- After any version-related change, report:
  - canonical version from `library.json`
  - all synchronized files and the version found in each
  - files intentionally not changed and why
  - commands used for version scanning
  - build/test validation performed
  - any remaining mismatch or risk

## Session-Close Workflow

- Default session-close behavior:
  - commit the current work branch (`feature/*`) with `git add -A` and a
    meaningful English commit message
  - push the work branch to `origin`
  - run `pio run -e usb` from the repository root when `.cpp` or `.h` files
    changed
  - if that build succeeds, or was skipped because no `.cpp` or `.h` files
    changed, update the active `release/*` branch to match the work branch
  - if no suitable release branch exists or no release branch is in scope,
    report that and skip the release update unless the user explicitly asks to
    create or update one
  - prefer fast-forward updates for the release branch
  - if fast-forward is not possible, ask explicitly before using
    `--force-with-lease`
  - push the updated release branch

## Code Rules

- Code comments must be in English.
- Identifiers and function names must be in English.
- Error and log messages must be in English.
- Emojis are forbidden in code, comments, logs, and generated outputs.
- Favor small, coherent changes over broad speculative refactors.
- Keep hardware-facing and configuration-sensitive changes conservative.

## Documentation Exception

- Markdown prose is exempt from flash-oriented logging brevity rules.
- Markdown prose may use readable long-form tags such as `[WARNING]`, `[NOTE]`,
  and `[INFO]`.
- Code blocks inside Markdown are not exempt. Code examples and text log
  examples must still follow the global logging policy from this file.
- Documentation must still be written in English unless the user explicitly
  requests a different language for a specific document.

## Logging Policy

All source code, headers, examples, tests, and code blocks inside Markdown must
follow this policy.

- Log messages must use short ASCII-only severity tags:
  - `[E]` error
  - `[W]` warning
  - `[I]` info
  - `[D]` debug
  - `[T]` trace
- Long tags such as `[ERROR]`, `[WARNING]`, `[INFO]`, `[DEBUG]`, and `[SUCCESS]`
  are forbidden in code/log output.
- Verbose is not a severity level. Verbose controls whether logs are emitted;
  severity tags describe impact.
- Severity reassignment is allowed when technically justified.
- Log message updates are not public API renames.
- Keep log text semantically clear and as short as reasonably possible to reduce
  flash usage.
- Prefer common abbreviations such as `cfg`, `init`, `ok`, `fail`, `adc`, `pwm`,
  and `io` where clarity remains intact.
- Do not repeat information already encoded by severity tags, module prefixes,
  or surrounding context.
- IO and hardware-level logs are usually `[D]` or `[T]`. Use `[W]` for notable
  recoverable conditions and `[E]` for critical failures.

## Rename And Logging Interaction

- API renames and logging normalization are separate concerns.
- Do not mix logging normalization into API rename phases.
- Before any API rename, perform a full reference search with rg.
- After renaming, rerun rg to ensure old names do not remain in relevant
  project files such as `src/`, `include/`, `lib/`, `test/`, `docs/`, and
  examples when present.

## Tool Policy

- Prefer available VS Code or agent-workspace tools first when they fit the task.
- Prefer locally installed CLI tools next.
- Do not use unnecessarily heavy tools when simple search or inspection is
  enough.
- Known local tools on the user's Windows/PowerShell environment may include:
  - git
  - gh
  - rg
  - fd
  - jq
  - dasel
  - jc
  - 7z
  - pwsh
  - winget
  - choco
  - coreutils
  - node / npm
  - python
  - uv
  - platformio / pio, if installed for this repository
- Preferred tools:
  - rg for text search, audits, and reference checks.
  - fd for file discovery, audits, and reference checks.
  - git for version-control inspection and explicit version-control actions.
  - platformio / pio for PlatformIO build, upload, monitor, and test flows.
  - gh for GitHub PRs, CI checks, issues, and project operations when
    available.
  - jq for JSON.
  - dasel for YAML, TOML, JSON, or XML inspection when it is the safest fit.
- When searching for governance, agent instructions, workflow shortcuts, branch
  rules, pull request rules, issue rules, validation rules, version rules, or
  repository policy, include hidden paths.
- For governance searches with rg, use `rg --hidden`.
- For governance discovery with fd, use `fd --hidden`.
- Plain `rg ... .` or plain `fd ... .` is not sufficient for governance
  discovery because hidden directories such as `.github/` may be skipped.
- When governance files are known by path, prefer reading those files directly
  over discovering them through repository-wide search.
- If rg or fd is missing, report that and give a simple install hint instead
  of silently using a weaker search path for audits or reference checks.
- When reporting search results, include the rg pattern used and state whether
  hidden paths were included when governance, policy, workflow, or agent files
  were in scope.
- Do not assume every listed tool is installed on every machine. If a required
  tool is missing, report the failed command clearly.
- Do not install or upgrade tools unless the user explicitly asks.
- On Windows, do not assume sed or awk are available. Prefer
  PowerShell-native commands unless availability was confirmed.
- Shell command quality:
  - Prefer simple robust commands over complex shell-escaped one-liners.
  - On Windows/PowerShell, prefer single quotes for regex/search patterns.
  - Avoid PowerShell backticks in search patterns unless required.
  - If quoting fails, retry once with safer quoting; do not repeat equivalent
    broken commands.
  - If quoting remains unclear, simplify, split the search, or read known files
    directly.
  - Do not treat failed commands as evidence about repository content.
  - Distinguish command failure, no matches, missing files, and missing tools in
    reports.
  - Example: `rg --hidden -n 'workflow\.begin|workflow\.audit' .github`.
- Use dasel for YAML, TOML, JSON, or XML inspection and edits when it is the
  safest fit.
- Use jq for JSON.
- Use gh for GitHub operations when authenticated and available.
- Use 7z for archive inspection or extraction when needed.
- Use uv only when Python tooling is actually part of the task. Do not infer
  Python project workflows from the presence of uv.
- Do not mix jq and dasel syntax.
- Do not use deprecated dasel flags.
- Prefer structured tools over brittle text parsing when that reduces risk.
- Do not assume repository, branch, PR, project, or governance state. Verify
  repository state with git and gh, and verify governance state by explicitly
  reading the relevant governance files.

## Validation Baseline

- Use configured and enabled GitHub Actions or checks when they exist.
- Do not invent required CI workflows.
- If no enabled CI is configured, report that and rely on required local
  validation.
- Always run at least one PlatformIO build after `.cpp` or `.h` changes.
- Default build check:
  - `pio run -e usb`
- For affected examples, run the relevant example build.
- If only Markdown or governance files changed, skip PlatformIO build unless the
  user asks for it.
- Governance-only changes require a governance consistency check, but do not
  require PlatformIO validation by themselves.
- A governance consistency check means reading the affected governance files and
  verifying that agent routing, shortcut rules, branch rules, tool policy,
  validation rules, version rules, and reporting rules do not contradict each
  other.
- If tests are affected, run `pio test` for at least one relevant environment.
- Run relevant tests when tests are present and affected.
- Docker or image builds are not required unless configured in this repository
  or explicitly in scope.
- If a required validation cannot run, report that plainly.

## Mandatory Reporting

After file-changing work, report:

- branch used
- governance files read, when governance, workflow, branch, PR, merge, release,
  validation, version, or cleanup rules were in scope
- files changed
- concise summary of what changed
- validation run
- skipped validation with reason
- remaining risks or blockers

Inspect relevant diffs before reporting file-changing work. Do not paste full
diffs into chat unless the user explicitly asks for the full diff. Prefer
`git diff --stat`, changed file lists, and focused summaries. Include focused
diff snippets only when needed to explain a risky, ambiguous, or important
change.

## Final Rule

- Never mark an issue as solved or fixed until the user explicitly confirms it
  works.
